  % TOO LONG SENTENCE
  The recent growth of drone technology has sparked an interest in video stabilisation technologies.
  We present an algorithm based on ORB feature point matching to perform video stabilisation.
  The algorithm is demonstrated to generate panoramic map images using drone video footage.
  We analysed the numerical stability our algorithm by comparing the estimated distance of two point and the true value.
	Our model works well in low lying areas but fails to produce meaningful results in videos displaying parallax
