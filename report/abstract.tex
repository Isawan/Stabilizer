  % TOO LONG SENTENCE
  The recent growth of drone technology has sparked an interest in the video stablisation technologies.
  We present an algorithm based on ORB feature point matching to perform video stablisation.
  The algorithm is demonstrated to generate panoramic map images using drone video footage.
  An error analysis of our developed method is given and we explore some of the visual artifacts that can occur as a result of our stablisation algorithm.
