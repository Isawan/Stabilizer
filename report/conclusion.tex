\section{Conclusion}

We demonstrated how feature point matching can be used to perform video stabilisation.
The stabilisation algorithm produces smooth videos and it was demonstrated that it also serves as a possible method for generating a panoramic images.
The methods presented here were shown to have moderate success in stitching UAV image of low-laying terrain, however problems were encountered in edge cases where not enough features are present,
or where parallax was a significant concern.
The analysis conducted is a useful first step in the process of developing software which may more easily perform geographical surveys, or help emergency services monitor those in danger and better visualise the path taken by objects of interest.
