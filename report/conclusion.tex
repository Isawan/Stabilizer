\section{Conclusion}

We demonstrated how feature point matching can be used to perform video stabilisation.
The algorithm produces smooth video and it was demonstrated that it also serves as a possible method for generating a panoramic images.
The methods presented here were shown to have moderate success in stitching UAV image of low-laying land.
Problems were encountered in edge cases where not enough features are present,
or where parallax is a significant concern.
The analysis conducted is a useful first step in the process of developing software which may help emergency services monitor those in danger, geographical surveys, or better visualise the path taken by objects of interest.
