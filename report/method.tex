\subsection{Camera model}

A pinhole camera model has been used.
We assume the surface being imaged is sufficiently far away from the camera.
This allows us to approximate each frame as an affine transformation of the previous.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{t+1}\\
    y_{t+1}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & b_{1} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & b_{2} \\
    0      & 0      & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_t \\
    y_t
  \end{bmatrix}
For numerical stability, we restricted our model to a subset of affine transformations:
rotation, scaling and translation.
This reduces the degree of freedom to four.
\end{equation}
