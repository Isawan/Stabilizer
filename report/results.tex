\section{Results}
\subsection{Simulated data}

The stiched output of the simulated data is shown in figure \ref{fig:simnoise}.
The distance measured is between center of the dark rings in the top right and bottom left corners.
The distance between the two points in the original image is 800 pixels.
The distance between the two points calculated from the video is 1647 pixels.
Correcting for upscaling, the calculated value is 824 pixels.
This is a deviation of 3\% after travelling 3 times the window size.

\subsection{Measuring tape}

Shown in figure \ref{fig:measure}.
The pixel to meters ratio is $1266.4 \text{pix} cm^{-1}$.
A plot of the calculated distance against the measured distance is shown in figure \ref{fig:expect}.
Figure \ref{fig:deviation} show the absolute deviation from the expected value.
The deviation is less than 1 cm from the expected initially.
A sharp deviation is observed beyond the $50 cm$ point,
corresponding to a discontinuity in the image.

\subsection{Drone footage}

The panoramic drone footage is shown in figure \ref{fig:drone}.
Minimal artifacts between the frames can be seen in the lower half of the image.
The camera is observed to shrink as it passes over tall buildings,
producing distortions in the upper half of the image.
